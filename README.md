One must have standards - a love? story.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form">Backus–Naur form</a> is a notation technique for context-free grammars, often used to define the standard for the syntax of languages used in computing, such as computer programming languages, document formats and communication protocols. In it ::= means “is defined by”, | means “or”, angle-brackets define a term explained elsewhere in the definition and a “+” after an angle-bracketed item indicates repetition.

Like all love(?) stories, a work in progress. Open for pull requests.
